# Evolve_Species
Evolution simulator written in Python. A Bit rough around the edges but it "kinda" works. 
The blue squares are creatures, black squares are monsters, brown dots are poison mushrooms, red dots are berries. 
The creature's behaviour is decided by it's "DNA", which, after each iteration, changes via an evolutionary algorithm
(can't remember the name) where we pick two of the fittest creatures, use them as parents, halve their chromosome, combine them,
and give a slight chance to mutate one bit of the chromosome to a random value.  

It honestly doesn't work properly but it does what it is supposed to do... kinda :P
